      <h2>HELLO THERE! <br/>
      WELCOME TO TENNI5 OPEN</h2>
      <p className="about-info"> TENNI5 OPEN provides a platform for you to host or join tournaments, individual or double tennis matches. Connect, meet with local tennis players and build a community to help expand tennis across the US. </p>

      <p className="about-info">Tenni5 Open was a vision that was created over the lack of exposure and familiarity with the sport of tennis within the US. Despite much attention and maketing placed with the US Open after all was set and done the sport cleared away, and for starters like myself it was hard to find fellow beginners that would share the same excitment and determination to grow as players. <br/> Tenni5 Open allows players from all different skill groups to host a match or a local tournament in their area and meet fellow tennis lovers or players who are not sure where they stand but would like to give it a go.   </p>


    <h2 className='subtitle1'>FEATURES</h2>
    <p className="about-info">Many small features to help fellow players were added starting off a player would need to create an account to host matches, join matches, edit matches as well as cancel any matches previously set. A messaging system is in place to help players communicate before and after a match, through this system only the two invloved parties would be able to access the conversation with a personal reference number. To futher assist players the user is able to search through a data base with all saved tennis courts locations within their area and have the ablilty to contribute any new information related to any court. Some features players with or without an account may access would be the equipment information, tutorial videos as well as tennis highlights related to the 4 biggest touraments the grand slams! In equipment the user would browse all neccessery and nice add ons to start playing tennis or add to your collection.  </p>

    <h2  className='subtitle1'>Love Grand Slams? </h2>
    <p  className="about-info">All highlights from the present and past years would be avaiable for all. Tutorials from experiened players would be available to help grow your game, new or experienced all information is greatly appreciated. All new information received from the community  would benefit all players.  </p>
